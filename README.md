### Installing/Building the Code
Our approach will be a Convolutional neural network algorithm (CNN). To build the code, we're primarily utilizing the Keras API running on TensorFlow. 

The following packages will need to be installed in order to build the code: keras, tensorflow, plotly, htmltools, caret, NbClust, and dplyr.
